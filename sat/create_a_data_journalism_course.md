With surging demand for journalists with data and development skills, more universities and colleges are including data courses in their curricula. Experienced data trainers from U.S. and Canadian journalism programs discuss the special challenges of building a data course that works. They'll share their best tips too.

This session is good for: Anyone who teaches data journalism and CAR skills, or would like to teach them, at the college or university level.

1. Buyin: Vitally important to get buy-in from first minute of first class.  Won't all be data reporters, but need to see the value. For teh computationally challenged, they need to be put at ease that they can do it.

2. You ahve to ahve reasonable expectations of what students can do and have all using the same, relatively small dataset on the project.

3. Seperate analysis from acquisiation. Obtaining government databases that are not . Have  do reporting first. Understand the data, inc why recorded, by whom and why.
4. Sequence of courses matters. In subsequent courses, ahve to do at least one CAR story. This gives incentive to pay attention in the data course.

** buyin **: Shows silent footage of security camera when bridge collapsed. Explain that you are editor of paper where.  Everyone is going to be sent on major breaking news. Careers are made and broken at moments like this. Ask for story ideas. Eventually someone suggests the "what happens". Maybe someone will suggest records. May need prompting. Challenge: what is the national story. There are 1000s of problematic bridges. They usually say "talk to experts". Each term, nobody initally thinks that there is a database. Look at the title of the class? Shows screen capture of what the database looks like. Cryptic. Database documentation explained.

Show example of reporter who succeeded by knowing how to do this. Whole thing takes 45 mins. But will have learned a lot along the way.

Show lots of stories, including ones done by students.

Data viz class without emphasis on story doesn't work.
Treat class as inv team. Size capped at 10 students.
Project will be cooperateive effort with local paper.
Expectation to learn all aspects in one term unrealistic?
Learned Tableau Public. Hope this preps for more advanced classes. ** One islated data journalism class just does not cut it. ** Needs to become integrated with other classes just as it is in the newsroom.

Data viz course.
Students need to select a subject concentration. Alwasy had to have a 

Everyone has a baseline = can make basic charts and embed in blog post. When this comes up, have office hours to support other classes. Review charts submitted to review quality of charts. Matrix of acceptable and unacceptable given previous instruction, eg no axis labels.

There used to be an all-class numeracy lecture. PCt change, means, medians.

Faculty workshop on pivot tables and how to grade data projects.

Restaurant inspectinos data is good one to use. Heavy users of restaurants, understand the yuck factor. Built up a library of data to use in examples

Students cometimes think there is a shortcut to learning the skills. Technical assignments must have journlaistic relevance. Learn SQL queries to find something newsworthy. Show that it's not technical skills but about journaism skills.

Best to have it part of an organic part of the curriculum.

**Q:** Code and programming?
Debatable that all journalists should learn to code. Do about 3 classes on scraping in Perl/Python. Enought to write a script to pull data. Arguing for a full coding for jorunlaists course.
