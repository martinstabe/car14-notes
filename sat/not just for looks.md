Design is key to attracting attention, keeping the public engaged and even getting people to do what you ask of them.

We'll look at examples from the BBC, NPR and The New York Times and share tips and ideas on what you yourself can do to design and present brilliant stories.

All graphics on online, broadcast graphics. Process for online team. We have specialised roles: designers, devs, journalists. 

1. Define: (Mark Bryson doc on defining mapping style) Get WWWW details on paper or Jira ticket. Know what tyring to achieve. Who has the right to have an opinion. Determine weekly checkin so info doesn't happen in drips and drabs. Also: write a headline. Really matters for the process Print it out and have it on the wall. Innoccuous personal ambition

2. Brainstorming. All hands. No used of the word "but". Encourage designers to understand the editorial process. Get in the newsroom. Journalists, don't come to us with a sketch. We want your ideas, but no one party should dominate. You will get better idea of interactive. Chance are, the first idea will be something someone else will have thought of, so keep pushing against that.

3. Wireframing and prototyping. Test frequently and early. Sanity check ideas. We are not normal people because we stare at this stuff all day. ** ProtoIO prototype.. Make a little card ipad.**

4. Refine and perfect stage. Get it pixel-perfect. Mobile-first grid. Consistent and optimised user experienced. Usability. Near/far sighted. Colour contrast. Greate xperience on feature phone, low bandwidth and brilliant experience on high-end device. Scale up from small device to biggerst.

5. Deliver: Test on a big pile of devices. Old OSs, old devices. Can create late nights before publication. Better to do that than last 

Case study: Doctor Who
Emersive. User testing: people click on "scroll down".

7 slides for 7 minutes. 
Am not a designer. bg in print reporting. Now run a team that combined social media, 20 devs and a brand new analytics team. Long time it was hard to describe what my team does. Alpha nerds of the newsroom. Stuff outside the CMS. Largely collaborative. Our ambitions outstrips our ability. We were stuck in our template. Were hand-updatting data running Flash grphics.

We are a product-development team. Sounds business-sidy.
We think most about projects that have to have a real strategy behidn them. Process nerds. Work with stakeholders to figure out what the goal is. (Boyer lauded). Waite/Adair pushed back against feature creep on Politicfact. Newsrooms are pretty good at doing things already established like  "single-pane interactives". Less good on persistante things, things that don't rely on home page to drive interesti 

Oscar ballot: Entire arc of coverage. Live blog, video, "party in a box". Will score the ballots and tell you who won. Things went off the rails. What happened was feature creep. 

If can't figure out what to do in first 7 seconds, its abig problem.

Fixed: "Oscares with David and Tony". Got rid of the Red Carpet stuff into its own interactive. This did great and made it a historical thing with searchable database. Slideshow lived on in a persistent way.

Got rid of teh tabs. Tabs are lazy. If only solution we have are tabs, we have failed.

Conciet was David and Tony watching the oscars. Mystery Science 3000 -- left it on all throughout the broadcast. Delay reduced to a few seconds.

moved ballot down, but had to prioritise. 
only a cool feature of 120k people of the millions going to this page. 

Have to start thinking about these projects as product. What are we trying to achieve, what is the audience, how do we know we reached them?

At the top you have "our story", our editorial picks. At the bottom you hve the data elements that the reader can play with to use their own story. Don't know it works. Tracked it with EventTracker. Any event in javascript we can track. So do users use this? Turns out they do.

need to get better at building product. We are good at editorial, but need to get better atbuilding product

[NPR T-shirt project](planetmoney.com/shirt). Made just before the merger. Web only project. 8 people others brougth in 3 multimedia producers, apps editor, 2 des-devs, 1 writer, one overall editor.

Kickstarter funding for 500k.

created a visual style guide for the visual material gathered. Even down to the lenses that woudl be used.

One major inspiration; [serangeti Lion project from NatGeo](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/serengeti-lion/index.html)

Users can jump beteen chapters, but also very clear about what they should do. Giant play button, but provde a hint and prompt to scroll.

Included a letter with the shrt when it was sent out asking for a picture with the shirt.

You made this page with t-shirt selfies. Seeded it with ourselves and family to show what we wanted.

Can't stress how important testing is. Guerilla user testing around the office. Watched as people used the site, and things that they got hung up on and what worked smoothly. Resulted in siginciant changes to the site. People were confused by the lack of setup. So before launch, added a video that set the scene and establishing the casual voice. Blooper was left in deliberately.

Auto-play video not liked -- seemed like control taken away. Prompted next video, and created choice of reading other thing. But that created too much seperateino.

Used mention of character introduced in the video. Needed to be edited in case people had not watched the video.

**Q**: How do you get the process right, and prevent senior people swooping in.

**HS**: Shoebanging important. Get people on board and by when. Tough deadline becaseut the dev takes time. Set out the timetable and the key. Signoff: Past this, you cannot have opinions. Being religious baout sticking to the boring admin stuff.

**Q:** To what extent is analytics now part of the process of driving design

**AP:** We're not where near Google testing 72 shades ofblue. It's one tool. 3rd project on hard core user-centred design process. Prototype will be sketched.  We don't do this enough in the newsroom.

Helps everyone to the point where they agree what the thing is. Helps decide what not to do.

**Q:** Role of planing process to the merger?

**AH:** Showed that teams working together.

**BB:** The teams having a ashared set of prioites would make everyone more efficienty

**Q:** Smaller orgs without the teams. How work toward better viz?

**HS** The process scales. Big orgs are very slow to pivot. So just do it. Can be faster than the BBC.

**AH:**  It's not about tech. Having a good story.

**Q:** Accessibility. How important?

**AP:** We need to improve dramatically. 

**AH:** Aware we need to be better

**HS:** Have a whole team at the BBC dedicated to it.

**Q:** Attracting interactions. At what point do you take a laryer out of the cake

**AP:** Not dug deep into it. One-person analytics team only just starting on this in April 2013. Not yet a consistent part of our process. We will eventually be able to see speedbumps in near real-time. Can do with Goolge Analytics.
