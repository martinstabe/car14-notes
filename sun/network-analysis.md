Knight Lab: Dec 2010 start; lunched by Knight Foundation etc and work for NU.

Have some student fellowships. Also do professional tech dev. Some tools. Timeline tool, audio

Will move chairs and go on a workshop. Design thinking methodologies. Design thinking workshop, howpefully to do this for your own projects.

[Untangled Project](untangled.knightlab.com): We haven't sreally seen much SNA in journalism. Eventough we constantly do network stories.

News spreads thorugh social networks, but networks are any set of relationships in 

Network diagrams

* Post
* Dallas morning news
* Richmond Times-Dispatch, They Run Richmond

We are seeing charts, but not seeing much *network analysis*. It is booming in many disciplines, but not really journalism. Why is that, and what is missing.

Understand networks of influence. Diagrams might be useful, but they are not the purpose of this.

* Closeness centrality: Fewest average hops to all other people
* Betweenness centralisty: Who is a broker who connects otherwise disparate. "Structural holes" - give the brokers a lot of power because they control communication.
* Modularity: Who is part of which group. How do people cluster into groups.

Outside journalism. Companies analysisng email and phone communciations to find out who is influential internally.

Would eb cool if:

* Analyse email and phone metadata in a governament agency to understand who the influential players are.
* Campaign finance reports to see who is influential without givne much money
* Understand cirles of reidns/supporters that a politican has.
* *And* report ethe findings based on Data 

Tools
Lots are availanle (Node, Gephi). Probelm is data acquisition.

* data acquisiation. Are surveys needed, for example?
* Data enhancement. Esp, inconsitent recording of names
* document results of reporting. If whole newsroom could contribute to a network of retlatinoships
* New ideas for presentation. Jacqui Marr, NYT (ph): can we not move beyond circles and lines

Commit to gon on an adventure.
