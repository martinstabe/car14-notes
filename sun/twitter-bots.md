job postings bot

Abe, Chi Trib news apps team. [Campaign contributions bot](https://twitter.com/ilcampaigncash). 

Chron job every five minutes; looks for new contributions, downloads, processes them and if they meet the criteria, Tweets them.

Some editors were excited, but some wondered wiether this 
would tip off our competition. 

Convinced them that it was already public. Nothings stopping them. The benefit from the Trib is that we are doing something interesting with the stuff. Builds reputation, is transparent.

Innitally use a private Twitter account. Could also be doing particularly for the newsroom. It's Twitter but not everything 

tough to give personality to automated Tweets.
Icon can give good personality
NYT 4th down bot is not bot (!!)
Don't be too jokey. Dangerious to automate humour. 

Your Reps on Guns bot.
Wierd Twitter: Bot that looks for Haikus and retweets them.
heiku.nytimes.com -- uses the Times API to find accidental heikus in site.
Not really newsworthy. just a way to be more whimsical and draw people to stories in a new way.

Propublica bots: web cam to window.

Florida Man -- searches for headlines featuring Florida Man
Pentamatron -- finds iambic pentameter cuplets from tweets
Python NLTK -- library of syllables etc
