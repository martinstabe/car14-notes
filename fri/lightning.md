Lightening talks

** Gosskopf **

A lot of ode is really bad. Will be read and modified more than read. Refeactor all the things. (Improve quality without adding features)

Follow code smells.

1. Duplicatated code. If in program twice, it's wrong.
2. Long functions. If long functions. Make cats shorter+kittens. Better than long cat
3. inconsistent style. Probably means you don't know what it means.

Means code easier to use, understand. (Probably you)
Develop good habits. Buildd habits by refactoring.

Otherwise, your code is like word clouds -- bad.

Favourtie wee things

1. Small multiples chart form. Lots of small graphics that cna be compared
2. Tiny text. Tiny words can highight diffefernce in size or content. Or outliers.
3. Tiny art 
4. Baby steps: eg tiny people of people showing motion in Olympics, dance moves, origami
5. Mini maps. can be zoomed out version to bigger map. Familiar from sublime text
6. Tiny things for words: tiny images in type in old books.
7. Minigraphics: Sparklines.
8. Icons and symbols. Social and nav icons. [Noun project](http://thenounproject.com/) is a big repository of icons Fonts of states

[NLP in the kitchen](http://datadesk.latimes.com/posts/2013/12/natural-language-processing-in-the-kitchen/) ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fQL6HL-ozxMa-NOft3FCHFmzR6qBJQuDNmfLlMXqoM8/edit)). -- teaching computers to understand human speecg
Python library nlp toolkit
recipe archive
465k line text dump of all recipes, including 6k reciepies. Needed all of the fields that exitstd
Going by hand was not an option
Regex not coing to work

1. Go through line by line
2. Classify each line asone field
3. Circle back and put in database
4. human reviews

You need to teach it what to look for.

5 algo, data structures, and cs cncepts

1. vectorisation. 
2. Naive Bayes: classifier in machine learning. Solves classification of things.
3. Iterative algorithms - which loop to refine themselves. Solves lots of problems. Iterative money-weighted averaging. Assign ideology to camapign contributors.
4. Vantage Point Trees: For fuzzy search. Eg company names in campaign finance database. Solves problem of people who can't spell.
5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation: Topic modelling algo that assigns topics. Solves millenial laziness. Find unrelated sections about unrelated 

Learn math and computer science.

What to learn from Terrible Data Viz.

1. Not everything needs to be a chart
2. Watch your scale - how we make comparisons across charts
3. Know your data types
4. double check your info. Again.
5. Don't overdo it. Often the best wasy is the simplist way.

Calculus for journalism.
more maths and journalism.
math = creative.
calculus is the study of change, which is exactly what journalists should be looking at
eg. Compounding interst. Can compound at different increments, including continiously.

Chemical spill: How fast could a chemical be leaking from a tank?

Take a step furhter: How much spilled out. Riemann Sums, the area un der a curve.

Detecting what isn't there
Being censored on the internet.
Ghosting allows being an active user. But hides some of your content from other 
Chinese social media. Accounts to get banned, but also get ghosted. How do you know?

1. Do your homework, interview experts etc. Learn the quirks of the system you are studying
2. Collect everything. Selected list of 100 users who would get censored regularly. Bust tool: API
3. Constantly check if your stuff is still there
4. Difference betwen deleted and censored. Got different error messages between ghosed and self-deleted
5. create app showing [images that were deleted from China's internet](https://projects.propublica.org/weibo/)

YOU MUST LEARN 5 lessons from the history of data journalism

* The future. TBL. "Litteraly a new kind of journlsim." - David Plotz Slate Mag editor
-- seek ninjas
* Alternative facts from the past. 
*

1. Nothing we are doing is new. Lincoln Steffens wanted to bring Hegel to analysing city hall. Lippman was his intern
2. No, seriously, nothing is new. Leaks: WR Hearst. Later his rivals obtained his telegrams "Standard Oil Letters". Not on Google. Don't do a good job in telling our own history. Doesn't even exist on the internt. Read Citizen Hearst.
3. It's a wild world out there.
4. You have already been scooped by a computer. Dedman
5. It's about you or it's about the work
