Managing a data project presents challenges for any editor. Hear from a panel of veterans who have successfully guided data-based stories from conception to conclusion.


** SW **: the non-data editor. I didn't have to worry about data. There were people for that. People want local versions of numbers when [we](http://publicsource.org/) do a state-wide story. There was no real data on our [amusment park story](http://publicsource.org/investigations/pa-s-regulation-of-amusement-parks-falls-short-inspections-enforcement). We had to create our own. Our data is incumbent upon peoplewh are entering the data. Often we find they are not do it correctly. 

What kind of chemical spill fo 20 gallons takes so much to clean up.

** MB **: Also non-CAR background. If in the posistion to edit,  learn from your data reporters. Backstop your reporters even if you haven't worked it yourself.
Pilhofer said: "Think of databases as big filing cabinets in the sky, waiting to be unlocked and asked the right question"
Ask early about data. Check tipsheets. yOU don't need to reinvetn the wheel. Read professional and acamdeic literature to id sources. Data is not magic. Be as skeptical as you would be with human sources. All data are dirty. Only question is how dirty. Ask who collects the data and for what reason. Don't confuse the effort needed to get the answer with the importance of the information it contains. Think of data in concentric circles. Ask reporters to write a white paper. Methodology and findings. Ask reporters what worries them? Editors with predetermined storylines? Ask reporters how they verified the data. Did they keep a data diary (log of actions taken in analysis)

** MS ** ([Notes here](bit.ly/dataprojects))

* Lobbying Missouri. Using Tableau public. Trouble using on mobile etc. Focused on Who are teh users of this data -- voters, political junies, members of stte ethics commission.   Wrote user stories for each type of user. Helped to design features, eg a lawmaker lookup.
* Inconsistent names, so used Google Refine to clean up.
* Promote/share work on homepages, social media. Make sure there is good metadata for facebook.
* Make sure it works on mobile. Design mobile first.
