The charts are very badly designed; because they are not labelled, they force the reader to do a lot of interpretation using a key hidden away in the bottom right of the screen. This key is placed as far as possible from the main narrative in the top right. This forces the reader to dart their attention back and forth between these two points of interest to make sense of the charts and then move on with the narrative.

This could have been avoided if they had just used the narrative steps to build up the charts gradually (which they only do in the first few slides).  Instead (again with the exception of the first few slides) it is all just a fancy set of transitions to clear the screen between slides. In some cases, the animation is actually misleading because it collapses the lines of one chart into the axes of the next, visually implying that one chart is somehow a transformation or detail of the previous one, which isn't actually the case.
