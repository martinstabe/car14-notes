Building charts and graphs that are connected to live data

Speaker: Timothy Barmann

This demo will show how to create info graphics that automatically update themselves with live data. These charts, graphs and maps automatically reflect the most current data without any intervention beyond the initial setup. Examples include maps of power outages, graphs temperatures over the last 24 hours, graphs of national and local unemployment rate, fuel prices, etc. The session will cover how to get the data into a Google spreadsheet, how to schedule updates, and how to visualize the data with a chart or table that can be embedded on your web site. It will also touch on a more advanced method using PHP/MySQL that doesn't rely on Google.

This session is good for: Those who have a basic knowledge of JavaScript or other programming language will get the most out of the session
