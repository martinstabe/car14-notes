## Hacks or Hackers
http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/973/1245/

** Issac Wolf **

Obtained application forms that included a lot of personal information. CFAA threat and demanded back information. Also said they had contacted the FBI. Did the data breach story and reported around those documents.

Should you collect and store infromation that you come across online that are not meant for you


** Scott Klein **

Ethics in data journalism. PP are not allowed to make straw people when scraping the web. For example browsing the web as if we were a particular persona. ()Is subterfuge.) The ethics are evolving; there are a lot of issues that haven't come up before. 

For example: OfficeMax/Staples stories at the WSJ. Simulated visits from various zip-codes to see what prices you get back.

** Tor Ecklin **

Defends US v Auernheimer, a 3d circ computer crime case. Weave and defendent scraped email addressses from public site. Currently serving 41 months in federal prison for this. Similar to what lots of people are doing every day on the web. Seen as unauthorised because AT&T said it was. Not clear that the access was unauthorised.

Also Matthew Keyes - also unauthoriesde access 

Central statute to be concerned about, which will
CFAA -- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Unauthorised access to a protected computer. Problem is that the act doesn't describe what is unauthorised access. Courts are all over the place trying to understand this. Dangerous statute because it is so badly written. Anyone scraping data should be concerned about this law because you might be committing a felony.


**IW**: ability to show you have a journalistic purpose. If you have to misrepresent yourself or pass through a password should immediately be bright red lines. Want to be able to show that something was clearly in the public domain and not password protected. How clearly is this in the public domain. What am I going to do with it. Is there a deeper story besides the data breach?

**TE**: The problem is that the law is not clear at all. If out there and easy to get via Google. But if the website owner decides retroactively that what you did was unauthorised. But as Press you are slightly protected by virtue of who you are. See no substantive difference between my client and what Scripps did, except that my client was unpopular and they are the Press. They will go after you as a reporter, but it depends on how reputable you are and what sort of counsel is. Problem is a law written by people who knew nothing about computers.

**IW**: We knew the exact URLs to go to. All we did was tell the computer to go download the files 170k times. All fo the information needed to do this was readily available online. 

**TE**: Weev case simply looped through all the combinations of SIM card numbers. The threory is not the methodoly that matters. Doesn't matter how you did it. What's so scary is that it is a subjective standard that turns on the whim of the website owner to define 
Gawker published this. Which led to charge under Identity Theft Statute.

**IW**: Do you ahve the knowledge and skills to protect the information yourself once you have it. Decided to do all interviews in person. Got very expensive. Wanted to make sure we are not putting people at even greater risk of idenitity theft. 

**SK**: Often get into data use licences. Most personal information we've ever got at Propublica has come from the government. Biggest problems have come from mirroring a government website -- ad payments for television stations. These were all PDFs that the governemnts had recieved and published. Did crowdsourcing. All the cheques were part of the upload. In Document Cloud searched for "Pay to the order of" to find all the cheques. As far as I know the cheques are still on the FCC's website, though.

**IW**: What is misreprenataion when it's just computers talking to computers? There was no front page etc. the story itself is about taking a steup back from being a reporter. NPR story about reporter making fake name and applying for payday loan. But this is a misrepresntation.

Even if you fill out a form and say that you a jorunalist, the likelyhood is that a human will spot that and block your access is very small. So just tell the truth.

**SK**: [Message machine](https://projects.propublica.org/emails/). Email targeting. Didn't check box saying "I'm ready to bring down the democrats" on Newt Gingrich site.

**TE**: Reject physical world metaphor for what computers do. You can't decive a computer. It just does what it was programmed to do. You can't really lie to a computer.

**Jennifer Valentino-DeVries**: [WSJ Prices Story](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323476304578198373572451206?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424127887323476304578198373572451206.html) we discussed straw man with ethics editor and lawyers. Did not fill out straw man. Uses a cookie based system to spit out zipcode based variable. Looped through them to recod database. Decided this was not misrepresentation. Was computers talking to computers. Were just getting something already outtehere. 

**SK**: Point was this story was great and nothing unethical. Point was that it raised issues that have not had to be dealt with before. Good luck finding a journalism ethics book for an example on whether it's ok to change a variable in a cookie.

Question: some t&cs even forbid looking at a website and writing down what you find in a spreadsheet. Should we worry about these.

**TE**: Circuits are split on this. Likely to be the first thing in CFAA to go to the SCOTUS. Especially problematic because you may be in multiple jurisdictions, and you may now know which depending on what the law says.

**IW**: Reuters story sourced starbucks employees in LnkedIn. Is this violation of TOCs?
