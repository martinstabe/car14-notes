** Shane Shifflett, FOIA machine **

Tool to automate and track public records requests. 300 people using it.

** Ted Han **

DocumentCloud. What to do with the docs once you have them, to display them. Able to link claims in a story to speicif location in a document. Power of good workflow tools. Allows you to go through document making notes, and then later show some of those annotations to readers. Some weaknesses: spreadsheets


** Mike Tigas, Tabula **

Sraping PDFs with [Tabula](https://github.com/jazzido/tabula) manuelaristran, jeremymerill
PDFs area print format. Designed to ensure that the document *looks* the same across different devices. The format isn't great for sharing data. Cares about the form , not the content. Often used in malice to prevent reuse. Exmple last year, Minn Post showed that data could be edited and police publicly said they would only use PDF. Tabula only works with text-based PDFs. Scanned files don't necessarily work because they are like using a photo. Computer doesn't know the positioning of the text. Works a bit if ther is an ocr layer. Similar to Google Refine in that it runs in browser from local files. Allows you to work on something sensitive without uploading to a third party. What we use to power dollars for docs

** Tyler Dukes **

** Jonathan Stray, Overview **

[Overview](http://bitly.com/bundles/o_28ljdooe44/1) cuts the time to review docs from weeks to hours. The idea is that overfview sorts docs into groups. [Police misconduct story](http://data.newsday.com/crime/police-misconduct/) was document-driven. Wanted to prove that it's a problem that local gov had not addressed. How do you prove this? Download through API all bills proposed and passed in NY leg. Overview gives basic search and breaks into documetns. Finds ones that have particular terms in them. if you wnat more detail you can click down thorugh the tree.  Was lookign for laws that add oversight to police.   When you find something intersting. Invents a filing systme for docs, or applies ones you chose. Eg pick list of words to become folder headings.
If use in docCloud, you get the document cloud
